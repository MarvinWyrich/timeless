# timeless
Current version: 1.0

## how to use
Everything you need to use the framework is inside the *timeless* subdirectory. All .less files get imported in the framework.less file. This means you only have to compile or to import this file in your project to use all framework classes.  
Everything else, which is not in the subdirectory, is for demonstration purposes.

## description
Timeless is a minimal and easily adaptable Less framework which allows you to create responsive websites without starting from scratch. The framework is independent from current webdesign trends and the type of website you create, what makes it a kind of timeless. Timeless follows the mobile-first approach and mainly provides:

+ a typography system with vertical rhythm,
+ a fluid grid framework with relative widths,
+ a basic design for lists, forms and tables. You can remove the corresponding .less files to use your own styles.
